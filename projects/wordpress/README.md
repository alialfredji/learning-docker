# Wordpress Project

A friend of mine got this crazy idea of using Wordpress as pure backend, a NodeJS frontend server to expose contents that were cached on Redis, a modern ReactJS frontend and a message queue system to glue everuthing together.

This project brings all those stuff together using `docker-compose` to harness all the services.

> **IMPORTANT:** this project represent a crazy over architectural approach to a 
> simple problem. I am not crazy, I'm just trying to make a point with _Docker_.
